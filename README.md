# Evolution
A very basic evolution simulator in Python.

# Notes
There is preset data to run a basic simulation, as well as the option to fool around with certain variables.
There will be more features added in the future.
Data is saved to a .csv file in the same directory as the program named "evolution.csv". This is for easy visualization of data using spreadsheets.

# Bugs
If there is an issue with the program or something you'd like added, please add an issue to this repository.
